In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, the grandstand of Woolwich Arsenal's Plumstead stadium was burnt down by the suffragettes, as part of their nationwide bombing and arson campaign for women's suffrage.[29][30] The attack cost £1,000 in damages (equivalent to £102,913 in 2019), and so the same year the club moved across the river to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury.[29][31][32] In 1919, The Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of 1914–15. Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.[33]
